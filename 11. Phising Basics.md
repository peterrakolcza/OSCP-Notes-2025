# Cloning a Legitimate Website
```bash
mkdir ZoomSignin
cd ZoomSignin

# The `-e robots=off` will ignore robots.txt directives which might otherwise hinder our download. We'll download all files from external hosts with `-H`, limited to files on the zoom.us domain with `-Dzoom.us`. Finally, we will use `-nd` save all files in a flat directory structure in our current working directory.
wget -E -k -K -p -e robots=off -H -Dzoom.us -nd "https://zoom.us/signin#/login"
```
## Cleaning Up the Clone

We have a few things we need to do before our phishing page is ready for prime time. The first thing we should do is remove the OWASP CSRFGuard code, which presented an alert box when we first loaded the page.

```
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ grep "OWASP" *
csrf_js: * The OWASP CSRFGuard Project, BSD License
csrf_js: *    3. Neither the name of OWASP nor the names of its contributors may be used
csrf_js:                    this.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "OWASP CSRFGuard Project");
csrf_js:        alert("OWASP CSRFGuard JavaScript was included from within an unauthorized domain!");
```

It seems the warning is in the **csrf_js** file. Let's find the web page that includes this file.

```bash
kali@kali:~/ZoomSignin$ grep "csrf_js" *
csrf_js:        xhr.open("POST", "/csrf_js"+(typeof(resourceAccountIdRoutingURl)!="undefined"?"?"+resourceAccountIdRoutingURl:""), false);
csrf_js:            xhr.open("POST", "/csrf_js"+(typeof(resourceAccountIdRoutingURl)!="undefined"?"?"+resourceAccountIdRoutingURl:""), false);
signin.html:<script nonce="Sxwi1J4PRJSzTs4fu1bzvQ" src="csrf_js"></script>
signin.orig:<script nonce="Sxwi1J4PRJSzTs4fu1bzvQ" src="/csrf_js"></script>
```

The file name appears in several places, however, we're most interested in the main **signin.html** page. Let's delete this line from the **signin.html** page, save the file and reload the page. The CSRFGuard alert box is no longer displayed. This is a good start.
